# Changelog

All notable changes to BeatByte are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.2] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **Core domain model** (`beatbyte-core`), engine-free and fully
  unit-tested:
  - Lanes and lane sets (chords, held frets) with bitmask semantics.
  - Tempo maps (beats ↔ seconds, tempo changes ready), configurable
    symmetric hit windows and Perfect/Great/Good/Miss judgment.
  - Note events (taps, chords, sustains, HOPOs), special phrases and
    validated playable tracks.
  - Data-driven scoring: judgment-tiered points, streak multiplier,
    per-beat sustain scoring, weighted accuracy, and the Hype special
    meter (phrase gains, activation, beat-based drain).
  - The deterministic gameplay session (`TrackSession`): strum matching
    with anchoring, note skipping, overstrums, hammer-ons and pull-offs,
    sustain lifecycles, phrase tracking — identical inputs always
    produce identical outcomes.
- **Chart format v1** (`beatbyte-chart`): versioned JSON schema,
  tolerant reader with strict all-issues validation (version gate,
  numeric ranges, duplicate notes, phrase overlaps, note-count and
  file-size caps), path-traversal-safe audio resolution, chord grouping
  into gameplay events, and load/save helpers.
- Chart format specification (`docs/chart-format/`), gameplay rules
  documentation, ADR-0003 (chart format) and ADR-0004 (gameplay timing).

## [0.0.1] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Cargo workspace with the full crate architecture:
  `beatbyte-core`, `beatbyte-chart`, `beatbyte-audio`, `beatbyte-game`,
  `beatbyte-cli`, `beatbyte-editor` and the `beatbyte` application.
- Minimal Bevy 0.19 application that opens the BeatByte window and shows
  the boot screen.
- Continuous integration (formatting, clippy, tests, multi-platform build).
- Release workflow scaffolding for macOS, Windows and Linux.
- Project documentation structure with the first Architecture Decision
  Records (Rust + Bevy, workspace layout).
- README, MIT license, contributing guide, code of conduct, security policy.
