# Changelog

All notable changes to BeatByte are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-23

**The game feel milestone** (Milestone 6): BeatByte stops feeling like
a tech demo.

### Added

- **Session feedback bus**: judgment events are broadcast as engine
  messages once per frame; note visuals, particles, sounds and popups
  are independent subscribers (multiplayer-ready fan-out).
- **Pixel-confetti hit particles**: bursts sized by judgment (Perfect
  adds white sparks), sustain hold sparks at the receptor, a Hype
  activation salvo across all lanes — deterministic seeding, hard
  particle cap, zero allocations in steady state beyond spawns.
- **Trauma-based screen shake** on misses, overstrums and Hype
  activation (decaying, squared response — subtle by design).
- **The stage breathes**: highway brightness pulses on the beat grid
  (stronger under Hype), and a translucent Hype overlay glows when the
  meter is ready and breathes while it burns.
- **Combo-break flash**: a brief red wash so a dropped streak is felt
  without reading the HUD.
- **Procedural sound effects** — synthesized at startup, no audio
  binaries: menu move/confirm blips, a dry miss thud (rate-limited),
  a rising Hype sweep. Note hits stay deliberately silent: the music
  is the hit sound.
- **Menu & results juice**: the title breathes, the grade letter
  slams in with overshoot, the score counts itself up.
- `EffectSettings` resource (particles / shake / beat pulse toggles)
  ready for the accessibility settings screen.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-23

**BeatByte is playable.** First playable prototype (Milestone 5).

### Added

- **The gameplay screen**: five-lane highway with receptors, falling
  notes (chords, HOPO markers, sustain tails), all note positions
  derived from the song clock every frame — never from frame counts.
- **Keyboard play**: frets `A S D F G`, strum `↑`/`↓`, Hype `Space`,
  pause `Esc`. Inputs are timestamped with song time and fed to the
  deterministic judgment engine from Milestone 2.
- **Live HUD**: score, combo, multiplier (with Hype state), accuracy,
  Hype meter with activation hint; judgment popups and receptor
  flashes on every hit.
- **Screen flow** as explicit states: boot (background demo build) →
  main menu (difficulty select) → gameplay (with pause sub-state) →
  results (grade, score, judgment breakdown).
- **Players are entities**: each carries its own session component —
  the multiplayer-ready shape from day one.
- **Autopilot mode** (`BEATBYTE_AUTOPILOT=1`): the game plays itself
  perfectly through the real screens and input path, then exits with
  success only on a flawless run — the end-to-end validation harness
  used before every release.
- The music thread bridge: song clock reconciliation against the
  audio device every frame; missing audio devices degrade gracefully.

### Changed

- Dev profile builds `beatbyte-audio` at full optimization (demo
  synthesis + analysis: ~30 s → ~3 s at boot).

## [0.0.3] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **Audio infrastructure** (`beatbyte-audio`):
  - Decoding of OGG/WAV/FLAC/MP3 into analyzable mono buffers with
    untrusted-input caps, plus a half-band FIR downsampler.
  - The `SongClock`: an anchored, monotonic, fully unit-testable song
    timeline with snap/slew reconciliation against the audio device
    (ADR-0005).
  - Music playback on a dedicated thread (rodio) behind a `Send`
    handle: play file/buffer, pause, seek, volume, atomic position;
    the game runs silently instead of crashing when no output exists.
  - The analysis pipeline: spectral-flux onset detection (with
    per-onset strength and brightness), autocorrelation tempo
    estimation with octave prior and sub-BPM interpolation, beat-grid
    phase fitting, RMS energy envelope — all pure and tested against
    synthesized ground truth.
  - Deterministic signal synthesis (`synth`) and the original bundled
    demo track "Circuit Breaker" by The Null Pointers, rendered
    entirely by code (ADR-0006) — no audio binaries in the repository.
- **Automatic chart generation** (`beatbyte-chart::generate`):
  difficulty-profile-driven and deterministic — grid quantization with
  raw-onset fallback, strength filtering, density limits,
  brightness-driven lane assignment with jump limiting, chords on
  strong hits, auto-HOPO for fast runs, energy-aware sustains, phrase
  placement, loudest-window preview selection.
- **Real CLI** (`beatbyte-cli`): `analyze`, `generate`, `validate`,
  `inspect` now do real work, plus `demo` (renders the demo song and
  charts it through the actual pipeline). Proper exit codes.
- Analysis types (`SongAnalysis`, `Onset`) in `beatbyte-core::music`
  as the shared vocabulary between analysis and generation.
- Documentation: ADR-0005 (audio architecture), ADR-0006 (synthesized
  demo content), `docs/audio/analysis.md` including honest known
  limitations.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **Core domain model** (`beatbyte-core`), engine-free and fully
  unit-tested:
  - Lanes and lane sets (chords, held frets) with bitmask semantics.
  - Tempo maps (beats ↔ seconds, tempo changes ready), configurable
    symmetric hit windows and Perfect/Great/Good/Miss judgment.
  - Note events (taps, chords, sustains, HOPOs), special phrases and
    validated playable tracks.
  - Data-driven scoring: judgment-tiered points, streak multiplier,
    per-beat sustain scoring, weighted accuracy, and the Hype special
    meter (phrase gains, activation, beat-based drain).
  - The deterministic gameplay session (`TrackSession`): strum matching
    with anchoring, note skipping, overstrums, hammer-ons and pull-offs,
    sustain lifecycles, phrase tracking — identical inputs always
    produce identical outcomes.
- **Chart format v1** (`beatbyte-chart`): versioned JSON schema,
  tolerant reader with strict all-issues validation (version gate,
  numeric ranges, duplicate notes, phrase overlaps, note-count and
  file-size caps), path-traversal-safe audio resolution, chord grouping
  into gameplay events, and load/save helpers.
- Chart format specification (`docs/chart-format/`), gameplay rules
  documentation, ADR-0003 (chart format) and ADR-0004 (gameplay timing).

## [0.0.1] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Cargo workspace with the full crate architecture:
  `beatbyte-core`, `beatbyte-chart`, `beatbyte-audio`, `beatbyte-game`,
  `beatbyte-cli`, `beatbyte-editor` and the `beatbyte` application.
- Minimal Bevy 0.19 application that opens the BeatByte window and shows
  the boot screen.
- Continuous integration (formatting, clippy, tests, multi-platform build).
- Release workflow scaffolding for macOS, Windows and Linux.
- Project documentation structure with the first Architecture Decision
  Records (Rust + Bevy, workspace layout).
- README, MIT license, contributing guide, code of conduct, security policy.
